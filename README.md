# allocate

An offline-first To-Do application for avoiding burnout.

## Who is this for?

This application is primarily intended for neurodivergent folk who struggle with burnout. I wanted
to make
something which better suited my own needs and thought others may find it useful.

I hope that, one day, this app will be fully accessible, at the moment, it is not.

## Installation:

This is not yet ready for release, but if you would like to play with the project,
feel free to clone the project and build using Flutter. You will require a supabase api key
or to refactor to an online backend of your choosing.

Online is implemented but not fully tested.

## What has been implemented so far:

Full offline functionality:
-Creating tasks, routines, deadlines, reminders, task grouping
-Repeating tasks, reminders, deadlines
-Theme modifications
-Accessibility modifications (partially)

## What still requires implementation:

-Online testing
-Usage documentation

## Roadmap and future plans:

-see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

## How to use:

- TBD
