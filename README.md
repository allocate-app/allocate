# Allocate

An offline-first To-Do application for avoiding burnout.

## Who is this for?

This application is primarily intended for neurodivergent folk who struggle with burnout. I wanted
to make
something which better suited my own needs and thought others may find it useful.

I hope that, one day, this app will be fully accessible, at the moment, it is not.

## Installation:

- see: [Allocate Documentation](https://allocate-app.github.io) for full build and install instructions

- Clone the repository and build with flutter
    - If using online features, you will be required to start a supabase project and install the
      supabase cli

## Roadmap and future plans:
